# Bluecar-electric-car-services
Autolib’ was a company that provided rental electric car services in cities it operated in . It was first inaugurated in Paris back in December 2011 and ran all the way to 31 July 2018. The service had a large network across the city and maintained their Bollore Bluecar services through  paid subscriptions.

**Objectives**
This analysis attempts to answer the following questions:
 * Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.
 * What is the most popular hour for returning cars?
 * What station is the most popular?
      - Overall
      - At the most popular picking hour?
 * What postal code is the most popular for picking up Blue cars? Does the most popular station belong to that postal code?
    -Overall?
    - At the most popular picking hour?
 * Do the results change if you consider Utilib and Utilib 1.4 instead of Blue cars? 
 
 **Recommendations**
 The findings of this analysis lead to a few recommendations. The charging infrastructure in the above listed postal codes should be prioritized when it comes to maintenance seeing as they serve the greatest population of the company’s consumers. Special attention should be given to the postal code 75015 seeing as it is the most used out of all them. Resource distribution should therefore consider this postal code first before all others. The analysis also showed that Bluecars were the most demanded variant of electric cars and their number should therefore be increased to accommodate its large market demand.
